# New Window Tab

A chrome extension that fills a simple need. It creates a keyboard shortcut
(`Alt+Shift+W` by default) which pops out the current tab into a new window. It
automatically chooses the window location using chrome's suggestion for a
"natural" offset (about 10 pixels offset from parent's top and left). It keeps
the same window size as the parent window.

You can set the shortcut to what you want by clicking the **Keyboard
shortcuts** link at the bottom of the **extensions** page as shown below.
